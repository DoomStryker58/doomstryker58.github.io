		<h3>About Starman</h3>
		<article>When writing this song, David Bowie always had his objective to reach the younger audience. He would get interpretations of his music sent by his younger fans, which were expressed by their own words. And that is exactly the type of audience Bowie wanted to reach for. The song sets a perspective of hearing a "Starman" land on Earth, but since the common fantasy is that aliens come down to destroy Earth, Bowie had the opposite fantasy where aliens would come to Earth and enlighten the humans. As mentioned before, Bowie prefers to target the younger audience, so the song even mentions that the "Starman" told the humans to let the youth lead the way and have a good time.</article>
		<h3>About David Bowie</h3>
		<article>David Bowie, born January 8, 1947, London, England was a British singer, songwriter, and an actor, prominent in the 1970s and best known for his shifting persona and musical genre hopping. His songs have cameoed in various films, with one being my favorite: The Martian, in which "Starman" was featured in the film.</article>
